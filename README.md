# Stellar-Analytics
Trained a ML model for classify stellar objects.
The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model 
that classifies exoplanets into habitable, marginally habitable, and 
non-habitable categories based on planetary and stellar properties. 
The goal is to determine which exoplanets are most likely to support 
life using a scientifically derived Habitability Index.
